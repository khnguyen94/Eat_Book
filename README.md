# EatBook

## Summary 
Have you been overwhelmed by the endless slew of restaurant recommendations by friends and family? Are you someone who is lost in all the recent hole-in-the-wall and social media food craze? Eat Book is here to help! Search, review, and save all those local restaurants you have been recommended or want to try. Access them later and check them off as you go!

## Importance
This application allows for users to store restaurants in a to-do list type manner so that they can track what establishments they have visted and what they have not yet. The integration of restaurant reviews using Yelp's API and local city maps using Google Map's API create all the necessary tools for someone wanting to have a better and more intimate understanding of their city's culinary offerings.
